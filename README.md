Thursday Code Louisville Front-End coding project.

Code Louisville requirements attempted:


Flex & Grid to control multiple areas, Head & body. 
Main sections controlled by Grid. 
Javascript For hamburger Mobile Menu.
Media Queries.



Code Sources:

I tried code from multiple sources, including W3 Schools. Most was abandoned due to inability to implement.  However, the hamburger script was from adapted to my code from a YouTube video. https://youtu.be/HzJngc-Se9Q 



Jesus  I learned a lot. 

I was at first attempting to style only using html elements b/c i thought that classes would become unnecessarily complex. After having conflicting styles, I see why classes are used. They isolate the declarations such that code is clear & maintainable. But also so declarations don't conflict. Classes isolate functions such that declarations aren't broad,rather focus on a specific item.

Events must be triggered in the HTMl for Javascript to function. Don't remember that being covered in the courses, at all. A single mistake in javascript can break a separate, but functional script. You must complete and test a single thing at a time. This goes for all things, not just JS. It is also true for CSS. Especially true for CSS. 


Storing a variable seems meaningless if its just made up, but if its a CSS class or HTML element... then its power becomes immediately apparent in dynamically editing content for user experience. I believe this is the power of React. For a front end course, for me to have 'discovered' this seems underwhelming. I don't think that it was mentioned in a single video.
