                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. 
                    How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. If I paint something, I don't want 
                    to have to explain what it is. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his 
                    beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light.

                <h2>The Dirty Details</h2>
                <p>I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. As trees get older they lose 
                    their chlorophyll. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.
                <a target="_blank" href="tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text">"Try it Yourself"</a> link.</p>  
                <p>Let all these things just sort of happen. Just a little indication. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Maybe we got a 
                    few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your 
                    painting and get your floor wet.
